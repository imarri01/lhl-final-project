    In today's dynamic retail environment, accurately forecasting sales is crucial for optimizing inventory levels, 
    minimizing stockouts, and maximizing revenue. This project addresses the challenge of predicting future sales 
    across multiple products and store locations for a fictitious organization, accounting for various factors such as seasonality, product type, 
    and store location.

    The goal of this project is to build a robust machine learning model using Google Cloud's Vertex AI AutoML, 
    leveraging historical sales data to forecast future sales. The model will assist retailers in making data-driven 
    decisions to improve operational efficiency and profitability.

    #    The charts provide insights into the sales distribution and the correlations among numerical features in the dataset. The Distribution of Sales Data chart shows that the majority of sales are clustered between 10 to 30 units, with a noticeable peak around 15 units, indicating a common sales range. There are fewer instances of higher sales, with a gradual decline as sales numbers increase. The Correlation Heatmap highlights that the most significant correlation is between store_index and sales with a strong negative correlation of -0.79, suggesting that certain store locations consistently have lower sales. Additionally, day_of_week has a slight positive correlation with sales (0.18), indicating a potential weekly pattern in sales trends, while other features like temperature show minimal impact on sales. Overall, the analysis suggests that store location and the day of the week are influential factors in sales performance.

    st.write("""
        The Vertex AI AutoML Forecasting job was configured to build a sales prediction model by leveraging historical sales data.

        ### Key Configuration Details:

        - **Optimization Objective**: The model was trained to minimize Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), focusing on reducing large prediction errors.

        - **Time Series Setup**: The model used a 30-day context window to predict the next 30 days, capturing short-term trends and seasonal patterns.

        - **Feature Importance**: Key features such as `store`, `product_type`, and `date` were utilized to enhance the model's accuracy, with `store` being the most influential predictor of sales.

        - **Hierarchical Grouping**: The model also leveraged hierarchical grouping by product to make more robust predictions across different product categories.

        This setup allowed the model to effectively capture the temporal dynamics and key factors influencing sales, resulting in accurate and actionable forecasts.

    # - **Focus on Store-Level Strategies:** Given the high importance of the `store` feature, retailers should prioritize store-level strategies, such as optimizing inventory and tailoring marketing efforts.
    #
    # - **Product and Seasonal Strategy:** The significance of `product_type` and `date` suggests that different products have varying sales patterns over time, which should inform inventory and marketing plans.
