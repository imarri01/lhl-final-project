        The seaborn `relplot` shown in the image is a multi-faceted line plot that visualizes the `sales` over time for different `product_at_store` combinations, grouped by `product_category` (Snow and Water). The plot provides several insights:

        ### Key Observations:

        1. **Seasonal Patterns**:
           - Both `Snow` and `Water` product categories exhibit strong seasonal patterns, with sales peaking and dipping in a cyclical manner. 
           - The `Snow` category shows peaks during the winter months (as expected), indicating higher sales of snow-related products during this period.
           - The `Water` category shows a similar cyclical pattern, likely with peaks in warmer months when water-related products are in higher demand.

        2. **Product-Specific Trends**:
           - Different `product_at_store` combinations (as shown by the various colored lines) have varying sales patterns, but all follow the overall seasonal trend. This suggests that while all products within a category are influenced by seasonality, there are differences in their specific performance.
           - Some products consistently have higher sales (those with higher peaks), while others have lower sales across the same periods.

        3. **Store Location Impact**:
           - The line styles differentiate between different store locations (`Flagship`, `Suburbs`, and `Outskirts`). The patterns suggest that the location of the store also affects the sales trends:
             - Products in `Flagship` stores seem to have consistently higher sales compared to those in `Suburbs` and `Outskirts`.
             - This indicates that store location plays a significant role in sales performance, with central or flagship locations likely attracting more customers.

        4. **Yearly Comparison**:
           - The plot spans multiple years, allowing for a comparison of the same periods across different years. The consistency of the patterns across years confirms the strong seasonal influence on sales.

        5. **Category Differences**:
           - There is a visual difference between the `Snow` and `Water` categories in terms of the timing and magnitude of peaks. This further emphasizes the seasonal dependence of each product category and the importance of timing in sales strategies.

        ### Interpretation:

        - **Seasonality**: The strong seasonal patterns suggest that forecasting models must account for seasonality to accurately predict sales for these products. The cyclic nature is evident for both Snow and Water products, aligned with their respective seasonal demand.

        - **Store Strategy**: The impact of store location on sales performance should be considered in planning and inventory management. Flagship stores outperform others, which may inform decisions about stock distribution and promotional efforts.

        - **Product-Specific Insights**: Some products perform consistently better than others within the same category. This information could guide marketing and sales strategies to focus on high-performing products during peak seasons.

        - **Sales Optimization**: Understanding the specific timing and intensity of these sales peaks can help in optimizing inventory, staffing, and marketing efforts to align with expected demand surges.

        ### Actionable Insights:
        - **Seasonal Planning**: Plan inventory and marketing strategies around these seasonal peaks to maximize sales.
        - **Store-Specific Strategies**: Consider enhancing the product mix or promotional efforts in lower-performing store locations to boost sales.
        - **Product Focus**: Focus on high-performing products during their peak seasons for better returns.

        This `relplot` effectively visualizes the complex interplay between time, product type, store location, and sales, offering valuable insights into how to manage and optimize sales strategies.

    st.header("üõ†Ô∏è Model Training in Vertex AI")


    st.write("""
        The Vertex AI AutoML Forecasting job was configured to build a sales prediction model by leveraging historical sales data.

        ### Key Configuration Details:

        - **Optimization Objective**: The model was trained to minimize Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), focusing on reducing large prediction errors.

        - **Time Series Setup**: The model used a 30-day context window to predict the next 30 days, capturing short-term trends and seasonal patterns.

        - **Feature Importance**: Key features such as `store`, `product_type`, and `date` were utilized to enhance the model's accuracy, with `store` being the most influential predictor of sales.

        - **Hierarchical Grouping**: The model also leveraged hierarchical grouping by product to make more robust predictions across different product categories.

        This setup allowed the model to effectively capture the temporal dynamics and key factors influencing sales, resulting in accurate and actionable forecasts.

    # Key Performance Metrics
    st.write("### Key Performance Metrics")
    st.write("""
    - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 1.327  
      On average, the model's predictions are off by 1.327 units of sales.

    - **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):** 5.732  
      The model's predictions are off by approximately 5.732% relative to the actual sales values.

    - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 1.93  
      The RMSE indicates that the model's predictions have an average squared difference from the actual values of 1.93 units.

    - **Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE):** 0.074  
      RMSLE penalizes under-predictions more than over-predictions, making it useful when the target variable can have large variations or outliers.

    - **R-Squared (R¬≤):** 0.992
