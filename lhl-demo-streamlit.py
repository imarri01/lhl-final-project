    In today's dynamic retail environment, accurately forecasting sales is crucial for optimizing inventory levels, 
    minimizing stockouts, and maximizing revenue. This project addresses the challenge of predicting future sales 
    across multiple products and store locations, accounting for various factors such as seasonality, product type, 
    and store location.

    The goal of this project is to build a robust machine learning model using Google Cloud's Vertex AI AutoML, 
    leveraging historical sales data to forecast future sales. The model will assist retailers in making data-driven 
    decisions to improve operational efficiency and profitability.

    - The model performed well in capturing overall trends and seasonality but had some challenges with accurately predicting sales for specific products and locations.
    - Certain products exhibited higher variance in sales, which the model struggled to predict precisely.
    - Store location played a significant role in prediction accuracy, with flagship stores generally showing more accurate predictions compared to suburban or outskirts locations.

    Further fine-tuning and model adjustments could help improve accuracy, especially for outlier products and underperforming locations.
